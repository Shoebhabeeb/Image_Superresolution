**DEEP LEARNING BASED SUPER RESOLUTION OF SOLAR IMAGE RASTERS**

Image super-resolution is a branch of image process-ing  that  is  concerned  with  enhancing  the  spatial  resolution  andquality  of  images  by  learning  the  intrinsic  details  and  relationsbetween  the  lower  resolution  input  and  the  higher  resolutionoutput  images.  It  is  widely  accepted  as  an  ill-posed  problem,which  has  seen  tremendous  advancements  with  deep  learning-based  models.  In  this  work,  we  present  two  super  resolutionmodels,  Sub-Pixel  Convolutional  Neural  Network  (CNN)  andEnhanced Deep Residual Networks (ResNet), which can be usedfor   improving   the   spatial   resolution   of   solar   magnetograms.While  the  ill-posed  nature  of  problem  is  still  a  challenge,  thereare several application areas, including space weather prediction,which  can  greatly  benefit  from  the  improved  spatial  resolutionof solar magnetograms. Along with classical raster inputs we tryto  improve  the  model  objective  by  giving  HMI  Active  RegionPatches. We show that through our experimental evaluation ourmodels  perform  better  than  baselines  and  CNN-based  superresolution model provides viable results for magnetogram superresolution.
